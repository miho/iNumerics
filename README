Simple ODE framework for iOS. iNumerics currently uses ODE solvers from odeint (https://github.com/headmyshoulder/odeint-v2).


Requirements:

Mac OS X 10.7
Xcode 4.2
CMake 2.8

Compile:

Simple build:

cd path/to/iNumerics

./make.sh   (building for device)

or

./make.sh simulator  (building for simulator)


Manual build:

cd path/to/iNumerics
mkdir build && cd build

if you are building for device:

cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain/iOS.cmake -GXcode ..

or if you are building for simulator:

cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../toolchain/iOS.cmake -DIOS_PLATFORM=SIMULATOR -GXcode .. 


to finally start the build process:

xcodebuild -target install -configuration Release


Cleaning builds:

./make.sh clean

Usage:

The static library libinumerics.a can be found in path/to/iNumerics/dist

To use this library in an existing Xcode project, add the library as framework and add dist/include to the the project.
